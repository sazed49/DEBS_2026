This repository provides the official PyTorch implementation of **TrustFed**, a lightweight and unsupervised federated learning (FL) defense framework designed to detect and mitigate **label-flipping (LF) attacks** in safety-critical environments, particularly **autonomous underground mining systems**.

**Label-Flip Attack Detection via Trust-Weighted Aggregation in Federated Learning for Underground Mine Security**
(*Link will be updated upon publication*)

## 🚩 Motivation

Modern underground mines increasingly deploy:

* Autonomous haulage vehicles
* Robotic drilling systems
* Humanoid inspection robots
* Intelligent sensing platforms

These systems operate in **confined, GPS-denied, low-illumination tunnel environments** and rely on distributed perception models for navigation, hazard detection, and operational coordination.

While **Federated Learning (FL)** preserves data privacy by keeping raw operational data local, it introduces new attack surfaces. In particular, **label-flipping attacks** allow compromised clients to manipulate training labels and inject corrupted semantic information into the global model.

In underground mining, such corruption may lead to:

* Misclassification of navigation signs
* Unsafe vehicle redirection inside tunnel networks
* Incorrect hazard assessment
* Disrupted robotic coordination

TrustFed is designed to address these vulnerabilities under **heterogeneous, non-IID, and resource-constrained mining environments**.

## 🧠 Framework Overview

TrustFed enhances aggregation robustness through:

* 🔎 **Last-layer gradient norm filtering** to remove extreme anomalous updates
* 📊 **Class-aware gradient memory modeling** to identify suspicious target classes
* 📌 **Unsupervised clustering (KMeans)** in gradient feature space
* 📈 **Soft trust scoring based on cluster proximity**
* ⚖️ **Trust-weighted aggregation** instead of rigid client exclusion

Key properties:

* Does **not** require clean validation data
* Works under **strong non-IID distributions**
* Lightweight and suitable for bandwidth-constrained environments
* Theoretically grounded robustness guarantee

## ▶️ Running the Code

Each dataset has a corresponding experiment script or notebook.

Example configuration:

```python
RULE = "trustfed"
ATTACK_TYPE = "label_flipping"
attackers_ratio = 0.4
DD_TYPE = "NON_IID"
```

Run:

```bash
python experiment_federated.py
```

You can configure:

* Number of clients
* Local epochs
* Learning rate
* Dirichlet alpha
* Attack intensity
* Aggregation rule
